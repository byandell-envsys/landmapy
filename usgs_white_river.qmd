## Working with time-series from the USGS
In this notebook we'll walk you through how to access data from the
USGS Water Data initiative. We'll look at a USGS stream gage that
monitors flows on the White River located near Oglala, SD.

Read more about this USGS stream gage here:
<https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-06446000/>

```{python}
#| label: install-deps
#| eval: false
# !pip install --quiet geopandas hvplot geoviews dataretrieval
```

```{python}
#| label: fetch-data
from landmapy.usgs import get_usgs_data, find_usgs_site, get_site_metadata

# Find the site information dynamically
sites = find_usgs_site("White River near Oglala", "SD")

if not sites.empty:
    site_info = sites.iloc[0]
    site_id = site_info['site_no']
    
    # Get available parameters and period of record
    meta = get_site_metadata(site_id)
    
    df_daily = get_usgs_data(
        site_id=site_id,
        site_name=site_info['station_nm'],
        latitude=site_info['dec_lat_va'],
        longitude=site_info['dec_long_va'],
        parameters=meta['parameters'],
        start_date=meta['start_date'],
        end_date=meta['end_date'],
        plot_map=True,
        plot_series=True
    )
    print(df_daily.head())
else:
    print("Site not found.")
```

# Now it is your turn
Think of a heavy rainfall, flood, drought, or other hydrologic event
that you would like to tell a story about using data. When did the
event take place? Where did it happen?

Select a USGS gaging station that will help you tell this data story.

USGS NWIS Mapper:
<https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html>

Once you have the unique site number and lat/lon, you can either:

* Modify the code above that we used to look at the White River
* Copy and paste the code from above, and then modify

Add new code cells by with the `+ Code` button on the ribbon at the
top of this notebook.
