## Working with time-series from the USGS
In this notebook we'll walk you through how to access data from the USGS Water Data initiative. We'll look at a USGS stream gage that monitors flows on the White River located near Oglala, SD.

Read more about this USGS stream gage here: <https://waterdata.usgs.gov/monitoring-location/USGS-06446000/>

```{python}
#| label: install-deps
#| eval: false
!pip install geopandas hvplot geoviews dataretrieval
```

```{python}
#| label: fetch-data
from landmapy.usgs import get_usgs_data

# Fetch and visualize data using the landmapy function
df_daily = get_usgs_data(
    site_id="06446000",
    site_name="White River near Oglala, SD",
    latitude=43.2548611,
    longitude=-102.8268889,
    parameters=["00065", "00060"],
    start_date="1990-10-01",
    end_date="2026-02-03",
    plot_map=True,
    plot_series=True
)

df_daily.head()
```

# Now it is your turn
Think of a heavy rainfall, flood, drought, or other hydrologic event that you would like to tell a story about using data. When did the event take place? Where did it happen?

Select a USGS gaging station that will help you tell this data story.

USGS NWIS Mapper: <https://maps.waterdata.usgs.gov/mapper/index.html>

Once you have the unique site number and lat/lon, you can either:

* Modify the code above that we used to look at the White River
* Copy and paste the code from above, and then modify

Add new code cells by with the `+ Code` button on the ribbon at the top of this notebook.
