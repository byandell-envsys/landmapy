## Notes 6 Mar 2025

Multiple subplots across a page.

Change plot labels. Do outside loop.

```python
plt.xlabel("axis name 1")
plt.ylabel("axis name 2")
```

Change titles of plots

```python
soil_title = [,,,]
# in for loop:
axes[i].set_title(soil_title[i])
```

Line up several soil images across a page.

```python
# Combine the lists
soil_urls = p_soil_url_list + c_soil_url_list

# Set up subplots (adjust rows and columns for layout)
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=len(soil_urls), figsize=(20, 5), constrained_layout=True)

# Loop through each raster, open it, and plot in a subplot
cbar_mappable = None  # To store the QuadMesh object for the colorbar
for i, soil_url in enumerate(soil_urls):
    soil_da = rxr.open_rasterio(soil_url, mask_and_scale=True).squeeze()

    # Plot the raster on the corresponding subplot
    quadmesh = soil_da.plot(ax=axes[i], add_colorbar=False)
    axes[i].set_title(f"Raster {i + 1}")  # Add a title to each subplot

    # Store the QuadMesh object for the colorbar
    if cbar_mappable is None:
        cbar_mappable = quadmesh

# Add a global colorbar
fig.colorbar(cbar_mappable, ax=axes, orientation="horizontal", fraction=0.02, pad=0.1).set_label("Value")

plt.show()
```

## Fuzzy Logic Model 27 Feb 2025

You can find it under the "Modules" section on Canvas. Elsa has also provided a link to a conversation with ChatGPTLinks to an external site. that she had on how to implement fuzzy models using scikit-fuzzy in Python, as another resource for you.

A fuzzy logic model is one that is built on expert knowledge rather than
training data. You may wish to use the
[`scikit-fuzzy`](https://pythonhosted.org/scikit-fuzzy/)
library, which includes many utilities for building this sort of model.
In particular, it contains a number of **membership functions** that
can convert your data into values from 0 to 1 using information such as,
for example, the maximum, minimum, and optimal values for soil pH.

To train a fuzzy logic habitat suitability model:

1. Research S. nutans, and find out what optimal values are for each variable
you are using (e.g. soil pH, slope, and current climatological annual precipitation). 
1. For each **digital number** in each raster, assign a **continuous** value
from 0 to 1 for how close that grid square is to the optimum range
(1=optimal, 0=incompatible). 
1. Combine your layers by multiplying them together.
This will give you a single suitability number for each square.
1. Optionally, you may apply a suitability threshold to make
the most suitable areas pop on your map.

> **Tip**
>
> If you use mathematical operators on a raster in Python, it will
> automatically perform the operation for every number in the raster.
> This type of operation is known as a **vectorized** function. **DO NOT
> DO THIS WITH A LOOP!**. A vectorized function that operates on the
> whole array at once will be much easier and faster.

-   use hill functions to transform harmonized DataArrays into 0-1 DataArrays
-   multiply them together

for references and discussion of classes.

A 
[class](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)
is a function with output of an object that has new methods, which are in turn functions
defined in the class.
In addition, the `@property` decorator defines attributes for the object.
The main use of classes are to:

- add functionality to class
- streamline different functions with same parameters to keep track of metadata
