### Colorado Fires

[BirdNET](https://birdnet.cornell.edu/)
python code development

- 2-hour recording broken down into 3-sec chunks
- AI code works but needs recheck
- 3 fires in CO with 130+ ground truth sites

## National Biodiversity Status & Trends

### Description

RShiny app for National Biodiversity Status and Trends

- Web-based tool to explore and visualize data on biodiversity and wildlife across the US
- Goal: people can summarize data in specific National Forests/jurisdictions
- Project: build out data visualization and other functions 
    - Want to layer on ranges of threatened and endangered species, functionality to explore trend data where they have it 
- Motivation: US Forest Service mandated to report on biodiversity status and trends at national scale. Want to be able to look across spatial scales.
 Need experience with spatial data
- Will be working with RShiny

Overview of USFS motivation

- fire management: putting out, after, rec & wildlife
- increased freq & size of fires
- management of sensitive species
- how does fire impact species diversity
- automated surveys at selected points
- nationwide
    - multiscale: continental mandates, forest units
    - forest unit plans updated every 10-15 years
    - species, forest actions

## NEON

time: 20:58-38:30

81 sites

LiDAR, hyperspectral, and other data

### Tutorials

- want to build out tutorials
- programming in R, Python,
[GEE](https://earthengine.google.com/)

### Scaling

[AOP Hyperspectral](https://www.neonscience.org/resources/learning-hub/tutorials/aop-refl-py-geemap)
data and satellite data

- Jupyter Notebook tutorials
- want new lesson shocasing an ecological application (remote sensing)

Want coding based videos

- have some in place
- build on existing code chunks and videos
- NEON data
- want language agnostic methods

no strong preference for particular sites
